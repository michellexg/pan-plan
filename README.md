## Intended Market

Pan plan is a meal prep website in which users can plan out "what's for dinner". For those who spend way to much time trying to decide what to eat, they can easily choose from a list of recipes and fill up their weekly menu. Even better, a grocery list is generated for them to have a list for the grocery store. It's the perfect way to have it all thought out for you.

## Functionality
